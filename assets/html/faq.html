                                    Unfortunately, there is not a one size fits all answer to this. Because we have various loan products and lenders, we cannot guarantee the loan terms nor the APR rate. These also depend on the type of loan you need and your financials.

                                <p>However, you can complete the initial application to find out this information. Completing this will give you exact numbers, and <em>you are not required to take out a loan</em>.

                                    While the SBA provides some loan directly, the majority are supported and dispersed through various financial institutions and agencies. All of our partners are certified and regulated by the SBA through a rigorous process that evaluates their financial history, rates, successes, and more.
                                </p>

                                    These institutions are based all over the US. We try and match your loan with institutions closest to your place of business, if possible.
