                            The second phase is a direct match with a lender. Your information will be forwarded to the partner institution. That partner institution will have its own ways of working with you, including potentially another website and the request for additional materials. After you choose a lender, your direct engagement with the SBA will be complete. The SBA will continue to back this loan, but will not be your main point of contact.
